This website is created by me after learning django from free code camp 

NOTE[ problems: somehow @mediaquery is not working in css of my website
      so please open my website in laptop or bigger screen (display it on mobile is not working properly )
	
       (if anyone can fix that advance appreciation to you from me)
 ]


in here I use django to build that app and (html and css to design the website)
to store information of clients I use django db sqlite3 ( return of  /contact page submit info)

FEEl free to copy my code to  test and modify it

Any suggesstion will be appreciated to improve my skills
