In here I created a webapp using django and html,css ( note open the website in PC or bigger screen not mobile friendly)
This website is created by me after learning django from free code camp 

NOTE[ problems: somehow @mediaquery is not working in css of my website
      so please open my website in laptop or bigger screen (display it on mobile is not working properly )
	
       (if anyone can fix that advance appreciation to you from me)
 ]


in here I use django to build that app and (html and css to design the website)
to store information of clients I use django db sqlite3 ( return of  /contact page submit info)

FEEl free to copy my code to  test and modify it

Any suggesstion will be appreciated to improve my skills

to view the page  copy it then locate to the directory in powershell and type python manage.py runserver then type 127.0.0.1:8000 in browser to view (pip install python and pip install django needed)
